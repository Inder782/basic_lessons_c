/*
Object oriented programming is like organizing our code so that we can control what each part of the code do ,we can create various types of objects with similar features and we can 
control what one object does.

The main goal of Object oriented programming is to organize and manage the complexity in software systems . OOP achieves this goal by encapsulating data and behavior into logical units
called objects and providing means for abstraction inheritance and polymorphism.

Encapsulating the data means that to hide the data and behavior of one object from another , this allows the developer to control how objects interact with each other and helps prevent
erorrs and integrity of data.

Abstraction means that objects are defined in terms of their essential characteristics, rather than their implementation details.


Inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and behavior from other objects, which makes it easier to create complex hierarchies of objects that share common features. 
This promotes code reuse and simplifies maintenance by reducing the amount of code that needs to be written and tested.


Polymorphism means that objects can take on different forms and behave in different ways depending on the context in which they are used. 
This allows the developer to write more flexible and extensible code that can adapt to changing requirements.
